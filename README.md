# boilercontrol

## Overview

This is a (little bit hacky) utility for sending "call for heat" ON and OFF messages to my Siemens RCR10/433 receiver boiler control relay. (Note: the codes have since been updated to a generic 433MHz thermostat)

*NOTE*: The ON and OFF packets herein are specific to my receiver: they probably contain some ID that was exchanged during the "learn" mode pairing between receiver and thermostat.

Currently configured to use WiringPi PIN 0 (GPIO 17) to transmit on (should be connected to DATA pin of a 433Mhz transmitter). GPIO pin 17 should be configured for export with `gpio` which will make changes to ```/sys/class/gpio```.

```
gpio export 17 out
```

NOTE: the install script will setup an init script (debian-compatible) that exports GPIO 17 with direction=out.

## Usage

To call for heat (turn boiler ON):

    callforheat 1

To cancel call for heat (turn boiler OFF):

    callforheat 0

NOTE: sudo is not needed if GPIO-Admin was used the export the pins and the current user is in the gpio group. Otherwise, sudo is needed when executing, to ensure that the pin is accessible.

## Dependencies

[WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/)

```sudo apt-get install wiringpi```

## Build

To build a version with the transmit pin control stubbed:

    make

To build for the Raspberry PI:

    make PLATFORM=pi

To install on the Raspberry PI:

    make install PLATFORM=pi

To uninstall

    make uninstall PLATFORM=pi
